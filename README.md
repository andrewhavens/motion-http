# motion-http

Motion::HTTP is a cross-platform HTTP Client for RubyMotion that's quick and easy to use.

Supported platforms:
- iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS
- Android

This gem depends on two really popular networking libraries:
- [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) (for Cocoa platforms)
- [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) (for Android)

Please note that this library is still a work in progress. Please report bugs and suggestions for improvement!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'motion-http'

And then execute:

    $ bundle
    $ rake pod:install # for iOS apps
    $ rake gradle:install # for Android apps

### iOS Specific Configuration

If you will be making insecure HTTP requests (not HTTPS), you will need to explicitly allow insecure HTTP requests by adding this line to your app's configuration in your Rakefile:

    app.info_plist['NSAppTransportSecurity'] = { 'NSAllowsArbitraryLoads' => true }

## Usage

Using `Motion::HTTP` is quick and easy. You can use the simple approach for making one-off requests, or the advanced approach of creating a reusable API client for further customization.

### Simple Usage

The basic syntax for a simple request looks like this:
```ruby
Motion::HTTP.method(url, params) do |response|
  # this block will be called asynchronously
end
```

To make a simple `GET` request:
```ruby
Motion::HTTP.get("http://www.example.com") do |response|
  puts "status code: #{response.status_code}"
  puts "response body: #{response.body}"
  if response.success?
    puts "Success!"
  else
    puts "Oops! Something went wrong."
  end
end
```

You can specify query params as the second argument:
```ruby
Motion::HTTP.get("http://www.example.com/search", term: "my search term") do |response|
  # ...
end
```

`Motion::HTTP` will automatically parse JSON responses:
```ruby
Motion::HTTP.get("http://api.example.com/people.json") do |response|
  if response.success?
    response.object["people"].each do |person|
      puts "name: #{person["name"]}"
    end
  else
    puts "Error: #{response.object["errors"]}"
  end
end
```

To make a simple `POST` request, the value passed as the second argument will be encoded as the request body:
```ruby
json = { widget: { name: "Foobar" } }
Motion::HTTP.post("http://www.example.com/widgets", json) do |response|
  if response.success?
    puts "Widget created!"
  elsif response.client_error?
    puts "Oops, you did something wrong: #{response.object["error_message"]}"
  else
    puts "Oops! Something else went wrong."
  end
end
```

`PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests work the same way:
```ruby
Motion::HTTP.put(url, params) { ... }
Motion::HTTP.patch(url, params) { ... }
Motion::HTTP.delete(url, params) { ... }
```

### Advanced Usage

A common use case is to create a reusable HTTP client that uses a common base URL or request headers.

```ruby
client = Motion::HTTP::Client.new("http://www.example.com")
# Set or replace a header
client.header "X-API-TOKEN", "abc123xyz"
# It is valid for some headers to appear multiple times (Accept, Vary, etc).
# Use add_header to append multiple headers of the same name (after creating with #header) .
client.header "Accept", "application/json"
client.add_header "Accept", "application/vnd.api+json"
```

Then make your requests relative to the base URL that you specified when creating your client.
```ruby
client.get("/people") do |response|
  # ...
end
```
